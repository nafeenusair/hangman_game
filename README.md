# hangman_game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn. The game ends when the word is fully guessed or the figure is completely drawn. Itâ€™s a fun and educational game that helps improve vocabulary and spelling skills.
